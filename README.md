# libp2p-ios

attempting to get go-libp2p working on iOS


Notes:
- run `pod init` inside ios/Libp2pTester
- open up the xcworkspace in xcode
- run `make` in the top level of this repo
- move frameworks/Libp2p.framework to ios/Libp2pTester/Libp2p.framework
- add that framework in the project build linking tab
- try building?
